# Claude Code Second Brain Skills

A collection of custom skills that transform Claude Code from a coding tool into a full content production system. These skills demonstrate progressive disclosure of context - there's no magic, just structured knowledge that makes Claude hyper-capable for specific tasks.

## What This Is

Most people think of Claude Code as a tool for writing and debugging code. These skills extend it into:

- **Content creation** - LinkedIn posts, X threads, presentation slides
- **Visual communication** - Excalidraw diagrams that argue visually
- **Documentation** - Runbooks, SOPs, and technical docs
- **Skill development** - Creating new skills to extend capabilities further

The system works through progressive disclosure: Claude only loads detailed instructions when needed, keeping context efficient while maintaining deep expertise for each domain.

## Brand & Voice Generator

Generate tone-of-voice and brand-system files that power the PPTX Generator and can guide customization of all the other skills. This skill walks you through creating your brand identity, defining your writing voice, and establishing your visual system.

**Core Philosophy**: Your brand and voice should be documented once and reused everywhere. The files this skill creates become the source of truth for all content generation.

## Skills Overview

### Excalidraw Diagram

Create `.excalidraw` JSON files that make visual arguments, not just display information.

**Core Philosophy**: Diagrams should ARGUE, not DISPLAY. The shape should BE the meaning. If you removed all text, the structure alone should communicate the concept.

<details>
<summary><big>✨ Key Features</big></summary>

- Visual pattern library (fan-out, convergence, tree, spiral/cycle, cloud, assembly line)
- Shape meanings mapped to concepts (ellipse for start/end, diamond for decision, rectangle for process)
- Color-coded semantic meanings (blue for primary, orange for start, green for success, red for warning)
- Detailed JSON structure templates for Excalidraw format

</details>

**Triggers**: Requests to visualize workflows, architectures, or concepts

---

### LinkedIn Post

Create authentic LinkedIn posts for AI/tech educational content.

**Core Philosophy**: Posts should sound like you, not like a template. Specificity, genuine voice, and earned insight beat formulas and prescribed phrases.

<details>
<summary><big>📝 Content Modes</big></summary>

- **Story** - Share what happened with real details
- **Observation** - Notice something others might miss
- **Take** - Explain why you believe something
- **Teach** - Share how to do something specific
- **React** - Respond to something happening in the world
- **Ask** - Genuinely learn from your audience

</details>

<details>
<summary><big>🚫 Anti-Patterns Avoided</big></summary>

- Template phrases ("Here's the thing...", "Game-changing")
- Engagement bait ("Agree or disagree?", "What would you add?")
- Performative vulnerability (struggle that exists to contrast with success)
- Abstract advice without real experience

</details>

**Triggers**: Requests to create LinkedIn posts, repurpose content into LinkedIn format, share AI/tech insights

---

### X Post

Create concise, engaging X (Twitter) posts for tech/AI content.

<details>
<summary><big>📋 Format Types</big></summary>

- Single tweets (under 280 characters)
- Threads (7-10 tweets for tutorials, lists, stories)
- Quote tweets

</details>

<details>
<summary><big>✨ Key Features</big></summary>

- Hook formulas (credibility, contrarian, curiosity, transformation, list promise)
- Source attribution requirements
- Thread structure templates
- Algorithm-aware posting guidelines

</details>

<details>
<summary><big>📏 Writing Rules</big></summary>

- No hashtags (they hurt reach on X)

### PPTX Generator

Generate professional, on-brand presentation slides and LinkedIn carousels using python-pptx.

> **Credit**: This skill was originally created by Rasmus and is [maintained here](https://github.com/Wirasm/presentation-slides-skill). The version here has been adapted with brand-specific configurations.

<details>
<summary><big>🎛️ Three Operating Modes</big></summary>

1. **Slide Generation** - Create 16:9 presentations with brand styling
2. **Carousel Generation** - Create square 1:1 LinkedIn carousels (exports to PDF)
3. **Layout Management** - Create, edit, and improve cookbook layouts

</details>

<details>
<summary><big>✨ Key Features</big></summary>

- 16 slide layout templates in the cookbook (title, content, stats, two-column, multi-card, floating-cards, circular-hero, quote, chart, code, and more)
- 5 carousel-specific layouts (hook, single-point, numbered-point, quote, CTA)
- Brand system with colors, fonts, and assets
- Batch generation (max 5 slides at a time) for reliability
- Variety enforcement rules to prevent repetitive layouts

</details>

<details>
<summary><big>💡 Critical Concept</big></summary>

**Visual-first layout selection** - content-slide is the LAST RESORT, not the default.

The skill includes a decision tree to transform bullets into visual layouts:
- 3-5 equal items → multi-card-slide
- 2-4 big numbers → stats-slide
- Comparing two things → two-column-slide
- Central concept with surrounding items → circular-hero-slide
- Powerful quote → quote-slide

Only use content-slide when none of the visual layouts fit.

</details>

**Triggers**: Requests for slides, presentations, carousels, PPTX, or layouts with a brand name

1. Definition of Done (checklist - most important, put near the top)
2. When to Use This
3. Prerequisites
4. The Process (numbered steps)
5. Verify Completion
6. When Things Go Wrong
7. Questions?

</details>

<details>
<summary><big>📏 Writing Rules</big></summary>

- Be specific (numbers, names, thresholds - not "as needed" or "regularly")
- Action-first steps (verbs, not descriptions)
- Warnings come first (before the dangerous step, not after)
- Clear decision points (if X, then Y - not "handle based on priority")

</details>

**Triggers**: Requests to document a process, create a runbook, build operational docs, formalize technical procedures

**Optional customizations**:
- `linkedin-post/references/style-guide.md` - Add your specific voice patterns
- `x-post/references/templates.md` - Adjust hook formulas to your style

You can use these skills immediately without any changes.

</details>

<details>
<summary><big>🟡 Medium Effort: Excalidraw Diagram</big></summary>

The color palette in `excalidraw-diagram/references/color-palette.md` uses a default blue scheme with semantic colors.

**To customize**:
1. Edit `references/color-palette.md` with your brand colors
2. Update the color table in `skill.md` (Color as Meaning section)
3. Keep the semantic mappings (start=orange tones, success=green tones, etc.) or create your own system

The current palette:
- Primary: Blues (#3b82f6, #60a5fa)
- Start/Trigger: Orange (#fed7aa)
- End/Success: Green (#a7f3d0)
- Warning: Red (#fee2e2)
